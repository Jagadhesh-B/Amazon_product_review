# Amazon Product Review Analysis :
The year was 1994 when Bezos launched Amazon out of his garage. In 1995, the first product was launched by Amazon. It was a book that was sold to 50 states in 45 different countries within 30 days (Oberlo 2021).

Within 26 years, Amazon holds the title of the world’s largest online retailer and has become a household name. Amazon has become synonymous with online shopping and continues to grow by developing new products, acquisitions, and different service offerings to enlarge the customer base.

Nowadays, people (almost 150.6 million) turn on the Amazon app for everything. Several types of research have proved that customers trust Amazon (Statista 2019). On average, the small and medium-sized businesses located in the USA sell more than 4,000 items per minute (Amazon 2019), which leads to millions of product reviews on Amazon.

Reviews tell what products and features are trending, what is in demand, what is no longer relevant, how products and those of competitors are doing, and much more.

It is observed that the maximum number of customers look at product reviews before they make a purchase. Survey results show that positive product reviews are a key factor for purchasing by 57 percent of Amazon buyers (Statista, 2019).

As product reviews are often the deciding factor for many customers, it’s very important to have a well-automated system for monitoring them.

The traditional manual process of Amazon product reviews is time-consuming and inefficient when millions of reviews are being posted all the time. It doesn’t show any trend or patterns over time. Moreover, it is tough to understand customers’ sentiment towards any product or its delivery. 

Review analysis must dynamically adjust to the changing trend.
